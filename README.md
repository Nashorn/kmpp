kmeans-js
=========

When dealing with lots of data points, clustering algorithms may be needed in order to group them. The k-means algorithm partitions n data points into k clusters and finds the centroids of these clusters incrementally.

The basic k-means algorithm is initialized with k centroids at a random position. This implementation addresses some disadvantages of this initialization method with the k-means++ algorithm.

The main algorithm assigns data points to the closest cluster, then the centroids of each cluster are re-calculated. These assignment/recalculating steps are repeated until the centroids don't changing anymore.

## Setting up a new instance

  var k = new KMeans();

## Attributes

### kmpp [Boolean]

Enables or disables the k-means++ initialization. If disabled, the inital centroids are selected randomly.

### maxWidth and maxHeight [number]

When you decide to initialize the centroids randomly, you should set the maxWidth/maxHeight attributes according to your data set.

### k [number]

This value defines the amount of clusters. You can let the module guess the amount by the rule of thumb with the guessK() function. It is crucial to select an appropriate value of clusters in order to find a good solution.

### maxIterations [number]

Defines the maximum amount of iterations which might be useful when performance is more important than accuracy. Disabled by default with the value -1.

### converged

Returns true when the clustering is finished, false otherwise.

### iterations

Returns the amount of iterations.

## Functions

### reset ()

Clears data points and calculated results.

### setPoints (points)

setPoints assigns an array of data points which should be clustered and calls reset(). Use the the format [{ x : x0, y : y0 }, ... , { x : xn, y: yn }].

### guessK ()

This lets kmeans-js guess the amount of clusters by the rule of thumb. (k = Math.sqrt( n * 0.5)). See below for advice for choosing the right value for k.

### initCentroids ()

The initial centroids are selected by the k-means++ algorithm or randomly. The latter behaviour is disabled by default. k-means++ finds initial values close to the final result, therefore, less iterations are required for the final result usually.

### iterate ()

As k-means is an incremental algorithm, the iterate function should be called until the centroids do not change anymore.

### cluster (callback)

Convenience function which calls the iterate() function until the algorithm has finished.

## Tests
